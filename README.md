# Fundamentals Of Data Analysis - Project

This repository contains my submission for Fundamentals Of Data Analysis, a module as part of the H.Dip in data analytics with GMIT (2020).

The file *Fundamentals-Project.ipynb* contains an explaination of the data set found in *powerproduction.csv*, attempts at training two linear regression models to predict the power output for a given wind speed, and an analysis of their accuracy.

*Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project 2020.pdf* contains the instructions for the project given by lecture Ian McLoughlin.

The *imgs* folder contains images used for explaination in *Fundamentals-Project.ipynb*.
